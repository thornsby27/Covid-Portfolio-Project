Capstone Project #1 Covid 19 Data

Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at the World Health Organization (WHO). You have been at your job for six months, and your boss feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked you to lead a project detailing analyzing global pandemic data — this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.
Question #3: How did it look in Japan compared to US for percent deaths.

The data is provided by Johns Hopkins University and shared on the following link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The data is organized by total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, new_deaths, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, population, etc. IT’S A LOT OF DATA!! 

The authenticity of this data is based on the accuracy/willingness of governments reporting their information.
