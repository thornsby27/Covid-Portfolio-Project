# Covid-Portfolio-Project
 ** IMPORTANT TO READ THIS PRIOR TO READING OR INTERACTING WITH THE DATA**
 
 This project was personal for me. I have family both in Japan and the United States. My parents and I were concerned about our family in Japan, especially since Japan has such a large geriatric population. However, Japan has dealt with SARS and other viruses in the past that people in the United States haven't had to encounter. Therefore people have been wearing masks there for disease prevention for decades. I have many memories of being in Japan and seeing people wear masks ( my aunt for example) when they're out in public. So I wanted to create this project just to compare how the two countries fared during the pandemic.
 
 
Capstone Project #1 Covid 19 Data

Scenario:
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at the World Health Organization (WHO). You have been at your job for six months, and your boss feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked you to lead a project detailing analyzing global pandemic data — this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.
Question #3: How did it look in Japan compared to US for percent deaths.

The data is provided by Johns Hopkins University and shared on the following link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The data is organized by total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, new_deaths, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, population, etc. IT’S A LOT OF DATA!! 

The authenticity of this data is based on the accuracy/willingness of governments reporting their information.
